## Overview

TimeWarp.Mediator v13.0.0 is the first stable release of our fork of the popular MediatR library. This release marks our transition from MediatR to TimeWarp.Mediator, featuring a corrected spelling, a more permissive license, and maintaining full API compatibility.

## Major Changes

- **From**: Apache License 2.0 (original MediatR)
- **To**: The Unlicense (TimeWarp.Mediator)
- New contributions are under The Unlicense, providing maximum freedom for users
- Original MediatR code acknowledgment maintained in NOTICE file

### üì¶ Package Rename
- **From**: `MediatR` / `MediatR.Contracts`
- **To**: `TimeWarp.Mediator` / `TimeWarp.Mediator.Contracts`
- Corrects the spelling of "Mediator" in package names

### üè∑Ô∏è Namespace Change

## New Features

### GetPipelineInfo Extension Method
A new diagnostic tool for inspecting registered pipeline components:

```csharp
string pipelineInfo = services.GetPipelineInfo();
// Returns formatted information about registered pre-processors, behaviors, and post-processors
```

## Migration

Migrating from MediatR is straightforward:

1. Update package references in your `.csproj` files
2. Replace `using MediatR;` with `using TimeWarp.Mediator;`
3. Change `services.AddMediatR(...)` to `services.AddMediator(...)`

See the [migration guide](./migration.md) for detailed instructions and automation scripts.

## Breaking Changes

- Package name change (requires updating package references)
- Namespace change (requires updating using statements)
- DI extension method renamed from `AddMediatR` to `AddMediator`

## Acknowledgments
