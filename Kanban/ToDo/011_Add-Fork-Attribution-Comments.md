# Task 011: Add Fork Attribution Comments

## Description

Add `// Modified by Steven T. Cramer` as the first line to all files that were present in the original MediatR fork (commit 8a64581). This ensures proper attribution for modifications made to the original MediatR codebase.

## Requirements

- **CRITICAL**: No open worktrees with uncommitted changes before starting this task
- Access to git history to identify original fork files (commit 8a64581)
- PowerShell script to automate comment addition
- All worktrees must be in a clean state due to the extensive file modifications

## Checklist

### Pre-Implementation Verification
- [ ] Verify all worktrees are clean (`git worktree list` and check each)
- [ ] Create a new dedicated worktree for this task
- [ ] Ensure no other development work is in progress

### Design
- [ ] Generate list of all files from original MediatR fork (commit 8a64581)
- [ ] Map original MediatR file paths to current TimeWarp.Mediator paths
- [ ] Determine appropriate comment placement for different file types (.cs, .csproj, etc.)
- [ ] Design validation strategy to ensure no files are missed

### Implementation
- [ ] Create PowerShell script to add attribution comments
- [ ] Test script on a small subset of files first
- [ ] Run script to add comments to all ~151 identified files
- [ ] Verify comments are properly formatted and placed
- [ ] Run full build to ensure no syntax errors introduced
- [ ] Run all tests to verify functionality remains intact

### Documentation
- [ ] Document the attribution process in CLAUDE.md or relevant docs
- [ ] Update any fork/licensing documentation
- [ ] Add note about attribution requirement for future contributions

## Notes

This task will modify approximately 151 files that existed in the original MediatR codebase at the time of forking. Due to the extensive nature of these changes:

1. **All worktrees must be clean** - Any uncommitted work could create merge conflicts
2. A dedicated worktree should be created for this task
3. The script should be tested on a small subset before full execution
4. Consider committing in logical batches rather than all at once

The fork was made from MediatR commit 8a64581. Files have been renamed from MediatR to TimeWarp.Mediator but maintain the same structure. Only files that existed at the fork point should receive the attribution comment - files added after the fork should not be modified.
